# BMI Calculator
This is a sample project for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI).  
It is an andriod app developed in Andriod Studio using Kotlin.  
The app simply prompts the user to enter height and weight information into the UI.  
**The formula for the BMI: 703 * Weight / (Height)^2**  
Once entered, the user can press on the "Calculate BMI" button which then  
shows the computed BMI in large text size below that button.
